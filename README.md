## About

Welcome to **MiniRT**, where we mix pixels and mathematics to create something that resembles a ray tracer!
This project is our humble (but not too humble) attempt to dive into the world of computer graphics, armed with nothing but miniLibX (or MLX42), a keyboard, and an excessive amount of caffeine.

**Why Ray Tracing?**

Ray tracing is that magical process that makes computer-generated images look like theyâ€™ve been plucked straight from reality - or at least from a well-lit, impeccably polished version of it.
Itâ€™s the secret sauce behind those jaw-dropping visuals in movies and games, minus the multi-million dollar budget and the Hollywood credits.
